My project is a personal portfolio. My portfolio contains 4 different pages(Landing page, About me(before poly & skills), About me(during & after poly), Contact me page).For all the pages, there is a navigation bar on the left side of the pages. My landing page contains a self-introduction of myself, it also contains an image of myself, my interests and my personality. The next page, About Me(Before Poly & Skills) Page, it contains my experience in Primary School and Secondary School, and it contains skills such as the applications I can use and different soft skills. The next page, About Me(During & After Poly), contains my current experience in Ngee Ann Poly and my career prospects. Finally the last page, Contact me, contains my phone number and email address, it also contains a feedback form.

Design Process
My design process is a personal portfolio website, this website is for those who want know more about me and for recruiters that wants to hire me.
I made this website to introduce myself to people that don't know me, and to present myself in the best way possible.
This portfolio helps anyone who sees the website know and learn more about me.

          Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity.
           People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go.
            Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.

FeedBack Form, it allows users to input their personal information, so that I can contact them. Users can also rate the entire website and write down the things that they think I can improve on this website.


Features left to implement
Animation. I wanted to add some animation to make the website a little more special.    


Technologies used   
HTML - It is used to to code the base of the website
CSS - It gives the website its colours, layouts and fonts
Microsoft Paint - I used to it draw the different icons like Word and Powerpoint


Testing
My feedback form has all the necessary errors shown when a certain area of the form is not filed up and it works the way that I had planned it to work.
My project is simplistic and easy to understand without any very distracting factors, it is always very easy and convienient to use with the navigation bar on the side to guide the user to the different pages available, there is even a feedback form for the user to fill up their personal information and feedback about my project. The project also works on mobile and it is displayed properly without any errors.
