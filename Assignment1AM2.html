        <h4>Current Experience in NP</h4>
         <p>The difference between NP and my schools before NP is that NP uses flipped classroom approach.The flipped classroom
            is basically the opposite of traditional learning, where instead of learning in the classroom and practicing at home,
            we learn on our own at home and we go to school to practice and clarify any questions we have with the teacher.
            Another difference is the size of the schools. All polytechnics are made up of many different schools in one campus,
            so the size of NP is massive. It is so big that I almost got lost trying to get to School of ICT on my first day of school.</p>

        <h4>Career Prospects(Post NP)</h4>
         <p>Being in IT has many career prospects as in Y2, we can still pick 2 elective modules, which we can then finally decide what
             path we would want to pursue. I would want to take up the Data Science & Analytics module, as well as the General module as it 
             is what I'm most interested. The job prospects of an IT student are also good because technology is rapidly advancing and so
             have a job in technology means that you will have a stable future.
